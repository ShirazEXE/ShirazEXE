# **About Me**

I like figuring things out. Even the slow, repetitive stuff that feels pointless in the moment. I’m drawn to building things that make sense, things that solve a real problem instead of adding more noise.
That’s all I try to create here!

# **Books I am Reading**
 - [Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI](https://anilananthaswamy.com/why-machines-learn)
 - [Understanding Deep Learning](https://anthology-of-data.science/resources/prince2023udl.pdf)
